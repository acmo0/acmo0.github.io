# Solution
We are connected in SSH in a restricted shell with very few available commands.
To see the available shell commands : `compgen -c`
An interesting command to try a privileges escalation is `vim`. However this is a restricted vim.
An other command catch my attention : `cowsay` which allows to display some messages in the terminal and sometimes a privesc is possible : https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/cowsay/

I used vim to create a file `text.txt`
```
exec "/bin/sudo /bin/cat /flag.txt";
```
Then by executing : `cowsay -f ./test.txt x`, we can cat the flag !
