title: About me
---

I am a Telecom SudParis student, passionate by **cyber security** (mainly cryptography, hardware and forensic), **Infrastructure**, **computer science** and **maths**. I made various projects which can be found [on my github profile](https://github.com/acmo0). I also enjoy CTF, I have a [root-me profile](https://root-me.org/acmo0) ! Some of my write-up can be found on this blog. I joined recently [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org), a  team of students who play CTF and organize the [404CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr). I also do some presentations on my campus about the RSA cryptosystem, symetric cryptosystems (especialy AES and block ciphers), differential cryptanalysis and Man in The Middle attacks using arp poisoning.

Since march 2024, I am also the IT manager of the team HackademINT. This introduces me to network management, IT automation, Kubernetes, object storage and many other technologies.
